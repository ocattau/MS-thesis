abstract = {Given the rapidly changing global climate, there is a growing need to understand the acclimatory basis of animal response to environmental change. To investigate the role of DNA methylation in environmental acclimatization, we generated a reference genome and surveyed the physiology and DNA methylomes of juvenile geoduck clams, Panopea generosa, under differing seawater pH regimes. Juveniles were initially exposed to one of three seawater pH conditions, followed by ambient common-garden conditions, then a second reciprocal exposure to ambient pH or pH 7.4. Within 10 days of the initial low pH exposure, juvenile clams showed decreased shell size relative to ambient pH with corresponding differential DNA methylation. Following four months of ambient common-garden conditions, juveniles initially exposed to low pH compensatorily grew larger, with DNA methylation indicative of these phenotypic differences, demonstrating epigenetic carryover effects persisted months after initial exposure. Functional enrichment analysis of differentially methylated genes revealed regulation of signal transduction through widespread changes in the Wnt signaling pathways that influence cell growth, proliferation, tissue and skeletal formation, and cytoskeletal change. After 10 days of secondary exposure to pH 7.4, naive juvenile clams were more sensitive to low pH compared to those initially exposed, showing reduced growth and having nearly a 2-fold greater change in DNA methylation. Collectively, this new genomic resource and coordinated phenotypic and methylomic response support that epigenetic mechanisms underlie acclimatization to provide beneficial phenotypes.

abstract = {Pacific geoducks (Panopea generosa) are clams found along the northeast Pacific coast where they are important components of coastal and estuarine ecosystems and a major aquaculture product. The Pacific coastline, however, is also experiencing rapidly changing ocean habitat, including significant reductions in pH. To better understand the physiological impact of ocean acidification on geoduck clams, we characterized for the first time the proteomic profile of this bivalve during larval development and compared it to that of larvae exposed to low pH conditions. Geoduck larvae were reared at pH 7.5 (ambient) or pH 7.1 in a commercial shellfish hatchery from day 6 to day 19 postfertilization and sampled at six time points for an in-depth proteomics analysis using high-resolution data-dependent analysis. Larvae reared at low pH were smaller than those reared at ambient pH, especially in the prodissoconch II phase of development, and displayed a delay in their competency for settlement. Proteomic profiles revealed that metabolic, cell cycle, and protein turnover pathways differed between the two pH and suggested that differing phenotypic outcomes between pH 7.5 and 7.1 are likely due to environmental disruptions to the timing of physiological events. In summary, ocean acidification results in elevated energetic demand on geoduck larvae, resulting in delayed development and disruptions to normal molecular developmental pathways, such as carbohydrate metabolism, cell growth, and protein synthesis.},

abstract = {The significance of the triploid advantage in terms of growth and survival varies across studies and environmental conditions. A meta-analysis was performed with 30 studies using chemically induced triploids and triploids produced by a diploid x tetraploid cross. The positive response ratios in 110 of the 121 unique experiments suggested in a significant growth advantage of the triploid oyster over the diploid oyster in whole wet weight and shell height. To compare growth and mortality locally, paired triploid and diploid Crassostrea virginica were deployed adjacent to commercial oyster farms in Alabama. Growth metrics and infection intensity of Perkinsus marinus were significantly different across sites and ploidy and, in all cases, the result was higher in triploid oysters. Triploid oysters experienced significantly higher mortality than diploid oysters at three of four sites and the results highlight the need for a better understanding of the triggers of summer mortality in triploids.},

abstract = {Geoduck clams (Panopea generosa) are an increasingly important fishery and aquaculture product along the eastern Pacific coast from Baja California, Mexico, to Alaska. These long-lived clams are highly fecund, although sustainable hatchery production of genetically diverse larvae is hindered by the lack of sexual dimorphism, resulting in asynchronous spawning of broodstock, unequal sex ratios, and low numbers of breeders. The development of assays of gonad physiology could indicate sex and maturation stage as well as be used to assess the status of natural populations. Proteomic profiles were determined for three reproductive maturation stages in both male and female clams using data-dependent acquisition (DDA) of gonad proteins. Gonad proteomes became increasingly divergent between males and females as maturation progressed. The DDA data were used to develop targets analyzed with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) in gonad tissue as well as hemolymph. The SRM assay yielded a suite of indicator peptides that can be used as an efficient assay to determine geoduck gonad maturation status. Application of SRM in hemolymph samples demonstrates that this procedure could effectively be used to assess reproductive status in marine mollusks in a nonlethal manner.},

abstract = {Molluscan reproduction has been a target of biological research because of the various reproductive strategies that have evolved in this phylum. It has also been studied for the development of fisheries technologies, particularly aquaculture. Although fundamental processes of reproduction in other phyla, such as vertebrates and arthropods, have been well studied, information on the molecular mechanisms of molluscan reproduction remains limited. The recently released draft genome of the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata provides a novel and powerful platform for obtaining structural information on the genes and proteins involved in bivalve reproduction. In the present study, we analyzed the pearl oyster draft genome to screen reproduction-related genes. Analysis was mainly conducted for genes reported from other molluscs for encoding orthologs of reproduction-related proteins in other phyla. The gene search in the P. fucata gene models (version 1.1) and genome assembly (version 1.0) were performed using Genome Browser and BLAST software. The obtained gene models were then BLASTP searched against a public database to confirm the best-hit sequences. As a result, more than 40 gene models were identified with high accuracy to encode reproduction-related genes reported for P. fucata and other molluscs. These include vasa, nanos, doublesex- and mab-3-related transcription factor, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors, vitellogenin, estrogen receptor, and others. The set of reproduction-related genes of P. fucata identified in the present study constitute a new tool for research on bivalve reproduction at the molecular level. {\textcopyright} 2013 Zoological Society of Japan.},

Based on comparative species analysis the Ostrea lurida transcriptome (41 136 contigs) is relatively complete. These transcriptomes represent the first significant contribution to genomic resources for both species.

abstract = {Background: The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (Mollusca, Lophotrochozoa) is an alternative and irregular protandrous hermaphrodite: most individuals mature first as males and then change sex several times. Little is known about genetic and phenotypic basis of sex differentiation in oysters, and little more about the molecular pathways regulating reproduction. We have recently developed and validated a microarray containing 31,918 oligomers (Dheilly et al., 2011) representing the oyster transcriptome. The application of this microarray to the study of mollusk gametogenesis should provide a better understanding of the key factors involved in sex differentiation and the regulation of oyster reproduction. Methodology/Principal Findings: Gene expression was studied in gonads of oysters cultured over a yearly reproductive cycle. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering showed a significant divergence in gene expression patterns of males and females coinciding with the start of gonial mitosis. ANOVA analysis of the data revealed 2,482 genes differentially expressed during the course of males and/or females gametogenesis. The expression of 434 genes could be localized in either germ cells or somatic cells of the gonad by comparing the transcriptome of female gonads to the transcriptome of stripped oocytes and somatic tissues. Analysis of the annotated genes revealed conserved molecular mechanisms between mollusks and mammals: genes involved in chromatin condensation, DNA replication and repair, mitosis and meiosis regulation, transcription, translation and apoptosis were expressed in both male and female gonads. Most interestingly, early expressed male-specific genes included bindin and a dpy-30 homolog and female-specific genes included foxL2, nanos homolog 3, a pancreatic lipase related protein, cd63 and vitellogenin. Further functional analyses are now required in order to investigate their role in sex differentiation in oysters. Conclusions/Significance: This study allowed us to identify potential markers of early sex differentiation in the oyster C. gigas, an alternative hermaphrodite mollusk. We also provided new highly valuable information on genes specifically expressed by mature spermatozoids and mature oocytes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Dheilly et al.},

abstract = {Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of farming sites, seeding date, age of oysters, ploidy level and rearing structures on mortality, pathogens and energetic reserves of oysters Crassostrea gigas. Mortality of oysters coincided with infections involving, primarily, the ostreid herpesvirus OsHV-1 and, secondarily, bacteria of the group Vibrio splendidus, when seawater temperature was between 17 and 24°C. Mortality started in early May and lasted until late September, with an interruption in July and August when seawater temperatures rose above 24°C. Mortality varied with farming site: oysters maintained in the open Mediterranean Sea showed no mortality and OsHV-1 was occasionally detected at a low level only, while oysters maintained in the farming area of the Thau lagoon exhibited mass mortality events concomitantly with outbreaks of OsHV-1. Mortality of oysters maintained in the Thau lagoon but outside the oyster farming area was sporadic and co incided with currents coming from the farming area where mortality was occurring. Mortality of oysters also varied with farming practices. Na{\"{i}}ve oysters remained susceptible to pathogen-related mortality pressure during their first 2 yr, whereas oysters that had survived a mass mortality event in the past appeared resistant. Mortalities of diploid (2n) and triploid (3n) oysters were similar during spring but mortalities of 2n oysters were double those of 3n oysters during summer and autumn. Finally, oysters grown in Australian baskets suffered 80% mortality compared with only 30% among oysters cemented onto ropes. The effects of farming practices on mortality are discussed in relation to pathogens and energetic reserves of oysters. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2012.},

abstract = {Veneridae is the most richly speciose family of heterodont bivalves with high ecological and economic value. Attention to the Veneridae systematics has been raised since traditional conchology-based ideas on relationships among the venerids were challenged by recent studies using molecular makers and other new approaches and methods. Herein, DNA sequence information from fragments of two mitochondrial genes (COI and 16S) and one nuclear protein-coding gene (H3) for 135 taxa (128 venerids, five nonvenerid veneroids and two other outgroups) are used to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationships of venus clams under maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference approaches. According to our molecular results, the traditional Veneridae is not recovered as monophyletic and most of the nominal subfamilies and genera formed para-polyphyletic clades. The findings indicate that the current venerid classification cannot validly reflect a natural subdivision. In the present study, the classification of taxa along the coast of mainland China within this family are also revised based on their phylogenetic position and morphological characters. The synonymization of chionine genus Placamen with Clausinella is rejected. Chionine subgenera Anomalodiscus and Cryptonema are given full generic rank again and incorporated into Venerinae and Tapetinae, respectively. Tapetine Marcia hiantina, M.japonica and M.marmorata were distantly related to Katelysia spp., so assigning those three species into the genus Katelysia by some malacologists is rejected herein. Our results also evidence that the synonymization of the genus Tigammona and Periglypta might be inappropriate. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Compared with understanding of biological shape and form, knowledge is sparse regarding what regulates growth and body size of a species. For example, the genetic and physiological causes of heterosis (hybrid vigor) have remained elusive for nearly a century. Here, we investigate gene-expression patterns underlying growth heterosis in the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) in two partially inbred (f = 0.375) and two hybrid larval populations produced by a reciprocal cross between the two inbred families. We cloned cDNA and generated 4.5 M sequence tags with massively parallel signature sequencing. The sequences contain 23,274 distinct signatures that are expressed at statistically nonzero levels and show a highly positively skewed distribution with median and modal counts of 9.25 million and 3 transcripts per million, respectively. For nearly half of these signatures, expression level depends on genotype and is predominantly nonadditive (hybrids deviate from the inbred average). Statistical contrasts suggest ≈350 candidate genes for growth heterosis that exhibit concordant nonadditive expression in reciprocal hybrids; this represents only ≈1.5% of the >20,000 transcripts. Patterns of gene expression, which include dominance for low expression and even underdominance of expression, are more complex than predicted from classical dominant or overdominant explanations of heterosis. Preliminary identification of ribosomal proteins among candidate genes supports the suggestion from previous studies that efficiency of protein metabolism plays a role in growth heterosis. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},
